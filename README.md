- **2D Transforms in Java Graphics2D**

    This repository consists of two exercises on using two-dimensional transforms. The exercises are written in Java, and they use the geometric transforms that are part of the Graphics2D API. The first exercise applies a variety of transforms to produce specific effects on an image. The second exercise draws a picture by applying transforms to some basic shapes.

- **Binary Tree Demo**

    This program uses a Binary Sort Tree to store strings in alphabetical order. This program also demonstrates tree traversal using recursion, stacks, and queues.

- **Books**

    This program reads books and, in the process, calculates the number of unique words a given book holds compared to the other seven books. 

- **ECardPanel**

    A GUI program that allows users to place images and texts on a panel. The images and texts can be movable. 

- **Graphics API**

    The Graphics API is a scene graph API for OpenGL 1.1. The graph library allows programmers to create 3D scenes by constructing a data structure that represents the content of the scene. The API defines the classes that are used to create the data structure. In addition to the library, it includes several example programs that demonstrate its capabilitites. 

- **GUI Spikeys**

    This program call SpikeyMain.java draws multiple spikeys in a panel.

- **Hangman and Minesweeper** 

    A Java Hangman and Minesweeper game.

- **Light and Material in OpenGL 1.1**

    This program shows a square "stage" with a variety of objects arranged on it. The objects use several shapes and materials and include a wireframe object that is drawn with lighting turned off. The user can rotate the stage about the y-axis by dragging the mouse horizontally.

- **LinkedList**

    A program that lets the user enter some words, which are added to a simple linked list. In the second phase, the user enters words and the program looks for the word in the list. If the word is found, then the position of the word in the list is output.

- **Maze Solver, SierpinskiTurtle, and TurtleGraphics**
 
    - A program call **MazeSolver** that creates a maze and solves the maze on the spot.  
    - A program call **Turtle Graphics** that draws different designs.The drawings are draw with recursive methods.
    - A program that makes Sierpinski Triangles by telling a virtual "turtle" how to move around in the window. The turtle has a "pen". If the pen is down when the turtle is moved, it leaves a trail.


- **NetDraw application**

    A program (NetDraw.java and NetDrawServer) that sends information to another computer(sever). The panel allows you to draw and stamp objects to the panel. When this program is run, it starts a netgame Hub that will listen on port xxx until this program is shut down. The Hub is a basic hub that simply forwards any messages that it gets from clients to all connected clients (including the client who sent the message). The NetDraw application allows uses to work together to create simple drawings. Everything drawn by one user is transmitted to the NetDraw server (or "hub"), which then forwards a copy to all connected clients (including the client that sent that item to the server). Every  client who gets the message -- except the one who sent it -- can then add the item to its own picture. This means  that an item drawn by one client is added to every client's picture.  Items are transmitted as strings that  describe the thing that was drawn. Only two types of item  are supported: Lines and stamps. A line has a color, a stroke number and two endpoints (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The string for a line consists of the word "line" followed by eight   numbers, all separated by spaces. The eight numbers are the R, G, and B  values of the color, the index of the stroke in the stroke array, and the coordinates x1, y1, x2, and y2. When the user drags the mouse while using the "DRAW FREEHAND CURVES" tool, a sequence of lines is produced. A stamp is one of a dozen images that are available in the Tool menu.  When the user clicks the mouse while using a  stamp tool, a copy of the stamp is placed at the point where the user clicked. The string for a stamp consists of  the word "stamp" followed by 3 numbers.  The numbers are  the index of the stamp in the stamps array and the x and y coordinates where the stamp is placed.

- **OpenGL 1.1: Anaglyph Stereo**
 
    Some objects in 3D.  The arrow keys can be used to rotate the object.  The number keys 1 through 6 select the object. The space bar toggles the use of anaglyph stereo.

- **OpenGL Textures**

    When run as an application, the program shows a window with two panels:  on the left, a PaintPanel where the user can draw 2D images and on the right a GLJPanel that shows a single object to which a texture can be applied.  There is a menu for selecting the object and one for selecting the texture. It is possible to apply the image from the paint panel as a texture on the 3D object, and it possible to copy the image from the OpenGL panel to the paint panel. This program depends on PaintPanel.java, TexturedShapes.java, Camera.java, and three resource files (brick.jpg, earth.jpg, and clouds.jpg) that contain images used as textures.

- **Pixel**

    A program name Pixel that allows users to manipualte images by manipulating its pixels. Pixel includes an array of image filtes for users to use. 

- **Search Time**

    A java program call SearchTimes that calculates the timing for certain methods to sort a list of words.

- **Spell Checker**

    A spell checker program that checks if a word is spell correctly. The program uses 5 subroutines that allow for a more presice grammer correctness. The Spellcheck.java program uses the TextIO.java and WordList.java class.

- **WebCollage**

    A program that crawls the web, starting from a given URL, collects all the images found in all URLs encounters. Right after, all images collected are placed in a collage.
