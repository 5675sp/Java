# Light and Material in OpenGL 1.1

**Lab6.java**: This program shows a square "stage" with a variety of objects arranged on it. The objects use several shapes and materials and include a wireframe object that is drawn with lighting turned off. The user can rotate the stage about the y-axis by dragging the mouse horizontally.
